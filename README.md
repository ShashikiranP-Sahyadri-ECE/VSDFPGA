# Task 3: VSDFSQUADRON UART Transmitter Project

## Overview

This project implements a UART transmitter (VSDFSQUADRON_FM_uart_tx) on the VSDFSQUADRON FPGA board as part of Task 3. The goal is to transmit data serially from the FPGA to a host computer via a USB-to-serial interface. The project includes Verilog code for the UART transmitter, a Makefile for building and flashing the FPGA, and instructions for testing the communication using a serial terminal.

## Prerequisites





### Hardware:





- VSDFSQUADRON FPGA board



- USB-to-serial adapter (e.g., FTDI or CP2102)



- Host computer (Linux or Windows)



### Software:





- FPGA development tools (e.g., Lattice Diamond or iCEcube2 for the VSDFSQUADRON board)



- make and a compatible toolchain for building the project



- Serial terminal software (e.g., picocom, PuTTY, Tera Term, or minicom)



- USB-to-serial drivers for your operating system

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShashikiranP-Sahyadri-ECE/VSDFPGA.git
cd VSDFPGA/Task\ 3
```
### 2. Hardware Setup





- Connect the VSDFSQUADRON FPGA board to your computer via the USB-to-serial adapter.



Identify the serial port:




```bash
On Linux: Use ls /dev/tty* (typically /dev/ttyUSB0).
```


On Windows: Check Device Manager for the COM port (e.g., COM3).

### 3. Build the Project

The project includes a Makefile to compile the Verilog code and generate the bitstream for the FPGA.





Run the following command to build the project:
```bash
make build
```
This will synthesize, place, and route the design, producing a bitstream file.

### 4. Flash the FPGA

Flash the generated bitstream to the VSDFSQUADRON board:





Use the make target to flash:
```bash
make flash
```
This uses picocom to communicate with the FPGA over the serial port (/dev/ttyUSB0 on Linux or the appropriate COM port on Windows) at a baud rate of 9600.

### 5. Test the UART Communication





- Open a serial terminal to monitor the FPGA's UART output.





- Using PuTTY (Windows):



![t42](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/125c498d-c291-431d-9541-3cce97dc9cac)


- Open PuTTY and configure it for a Serial connection:


![t41](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f197bbd9-c4df-41a6-b4d4-6dbe63d395b2)



- Serial line: COM3 (or your COM port)



Speed: 9600



- Connection type: Serial



- Click "Open" to start the session.



- Using picocom (Linux):
```bash
picocom -b 9600 /dev/ttyUSB0
```
- To exit picocom, press Ctrl+A followed by Ctrl+X.
![t3_1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40fa797e-7be1-48dd-bf27-5f6e460cc2a6)



Once connected, the FPGA should transmit data over UART, which you can observe in the terminal.

## Project Structure





- VSDFSQUADRON_FM_uart_tx.v: The Verilog source file implementing the UART transmitter.



- Makefile: Automates the build and flashing process.



- Other files may include constraints, testbenches, or additional scripts as needed.

## Troubleshooting




No Data in Terminal:





- Verify the baud rate (9600) matches the UART configuration in the Verilog code.



- Ensure the correct serial port is used.



- Check hardware connections and drivers.



Repetitive Zeros in Output:





- This indicates a potential issue with the UART transmitter logic. Simulate the Verilog code to debug.



- Ensure the FPGA is not stuck in a loop sending invalid data.





## Additional Notes



![t3_2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf8e04a2-e569-499a-816c-08dec2777e01)


The UART transmitter is configured to operate at 9600 baud. If you need a different baud rate, modify the Verilog code and update the serial terminal settings accordingly.

# Task 4: VSDFSQUADRON UART Transmitter with Sensor Inputs (uart_tx_sense)

## Overview

This project implements a UART transmitter on the VSDFSQUADRON FPGA board to send real-time sensor data to an external device via a serial interface. The "uart_tx_sense" project integrates a sensor (e.g., temperature or light sensor) with the FPGA, processes the sensor data, and transmits it over UART at 9600 baud. This README provides instructions for setting up, implementing, testing, and documenting the system, based on standard FPGA practices and insights from related tasks in the VSDSquadron_FM repository.

## Prerequisites





### Hardware:





- VSDFSQUADRON FPGA board (likely iCE40 UP5K-based)



- Sensor (e.g., TMP36 for temperature, LDR for light, or DHT11 for digital data)



- USB-to-serial adapter (e.g., FTDI or CP2102)



- Host computer (Linux or Windows)



### Software:





- FPGA development tools (e.g., Lattice iCEcube2 or Yosys for open-source synthesis)



- make and a compatible toolchain (e.g., icestorm for iCE40 FPGAs)



- Serial terminal software (e.g., PuTTY, picocom, or Tera Term)



- USB-to-serial drivers for your operating system

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

- Clone the VSDSquadron_FM repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/VSDSquadron/VSDSquadron_FM.git
cd VSDSquadron_FM/uart_tx_sense
```

### 2. Study the Verilog Code

- Locate the main Verilog file (e.g., uart_tx_sense.v) in the project directory.



- Review the code to understand:
- Sensor Interface: How sensor data is acquired (e.g., via ADC for analog sensors or GPIO for digital sensors).
- UART Transmitter: How data is serialized and transmitted (likely similar to VSDFSQUADRON_FM_uart_tx.v from Task 3).



Example code structure (hypothetical):
```bash
module uart_tx_sense (
    input clk,              // System clock
    input [7:0] sensor_data, // Sensor data input
    output tx               // UART TX pin
);
    // UART transmitter logic
endmodule
```
### 3. Design Documentation
#### Block Diagram:





- Components: Sensor, FPGA (with UART transmitter), USB-to-serial adapter, host computer.



- Flow: Sensor data → FPGA processing → UART transmission → Serial terminal display.



#### Circuit Diagram:





- Connect the sensor to FPGA pins (e.g., ADC for analog, GPIO for digital).



- Connect FPGA UART TX pin to the serial adapter’s RX pin.



- Connect the serial adapter to the host computer via USB.

### 4. Hardware Setup
Serial Connection:





- Connect the FPGA’s UART TX pin to the RX pin of the USB-to-serial adapter.



- Plug the adapter into the host computer.



- Identify the serial port:




```bash
Linux: ls /dev/tty* (e.g., /dev/ttyUSB0)
```


Windows: Check Device Manager (e.g., COM3)

5. Build and Flash the FPGA





- Build the project using the provided Makefile:
```bash
make build
```
This synthesizes the Verilog code, performs place-and-route, and generates a bitstream.



- Flash the bitstream to the FPGA:
```bash
sudo make flash
```
![t43](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/863c2f79-bb05-4668-83ea-51168708da02)

This uses tools like iceprog to program the FPGA via the serial adapter.

6. Test the System

Linux:
```bash
picocom -b 9600 /dev/ttyUSB0

Exit with Ctrl+A, Ctrl+X.
```
![t44](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e1cfe8d-9582-47f6-ba41-24d6fe7dec51)


Windows:

Open PuTTY, configure for Serial, COM3, 9600 baud, and click "Open."

# Task 5 & 6 : # 🧠 UART-Controlled RGB LED and Relay (FPGA Project)

This project implements a UART-based control system on an FPGA that cycles RGB LEDs and toggles a relay using UART serial input. Designed for platforms like the **VSDSquadron FPGA Mini**, this project uses a finite state machine (FSM) to react to each UART character received.

---

## 🚀 Features

- UART Receiver in 8N1 format (9600 baud)
- RGB LED color cycling: Red → Green → Blue
- Relay control:
  - ON in Red state
  - OFF in Green and Blue states
- Active-low relay logic supported
- Verified with **Docklight terminal** for UART testing

## Building and Flashing

```bash
make clean
make
sudo make flash
```

## 🔧 UART Baud Settings
Setting	Value
- Baud Rate	9600
- Data Bits	8
- Parity	None
- Stop Bits	1
- Flow Control	None

✅ Tested using Docklight serial terminal.

## 🧠 FSM Logic (Top Module)
Each UART byte received triggers a state transition:

State     | RGB Color | Relay
----------|-----------|-------
00 (Init) | RED       | ON
01        | GREEN     | OFF
10        | BLUE      | OFF

Relay is controlled by relay1_reg and is active-low.

LEDs are connected via a 3-bit RGB register.

## 💻 How to Use

- Program your FPGA with the generated bitstream.

- Connect Docklight/Serial Terminal to the board at 9600 8N1.

- Send any character (e.g., 'a', '1', 'z').

Observe:

 -  RGB LED color changes in sequence.

Relay turns ON only during the red phase.
